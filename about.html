                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let's get some basic things out of the way first. I'm 15, live in Davenport, Iowa, attend Davenport West
                High School as a sophomore and am interested in programming, software development, and building computers.

                <p>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I only started to delve into learning code languages and things computer related at the start of my
                  freshman year. So I don't have a ton of experience as I'm only in my second month of my sophomore year, but I already can confidently
                  say I'm definitely interested in pursuing
                  a career in a field at least closely related. The things I've learned so far that have peaked my interest most would be different code
                  languages. I'm definitely not a master of any yet and to be fair probably not very good, but I also have skipped around a lot and
                  haven't spent too much time outside of the classroom on
                  coding. What I mean by this is that I usually tend to get all my work done on my class projects in class on time. Which means that I'd
                  have to come up with a program to make just for fun if I wanted to do something new at home. Of course I saw this as too hard and just
                  didn't do anything. Anyways, originally I took a class called Computer Science Principles where I was taught Python. If I'm
                  being honest Python was very easy to learn which was surprising at the time since I figured a code language would be super complicated
                  . In all fairness though now that I have some experience in other languages/markup like java, javascript, html, and css I understand that
                  Python is very different from the rest and is probably considered simpler.<a href="myStory.html" id="readTag"> Read More...</a>
